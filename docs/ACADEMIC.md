# Deep Risk Model: Academic Documentation

## Abstract

This document provides a formal mathematical description of the Deep Risk Model, a novel approach to financial risk modeling that combines deep learning techniques with traditional factor models. The model leverages transformer architectures, temporal fusion transformers, and advanced factor analysis to generate robust risk factors and estimate covariance matrices for financial assets. This approach addresses limitations in traditional risk models by capturing non-linear relationships, temporal dependencies, and cross-sectional interactions in financial markets.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional risk models in finance rely on statistical methods to identify risk factors and estimate covariance matrices. These approaches often fail to capture complex, non-linear relationships in financial markets, especially during periods of market stress. Deep learning offers promising solutions to these challenges by learning complex patterns from data.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We formulate the risk modeling problem as follows:

Let $r_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represent the returns of $n$ assets at time $t$. The covariance matrix $\Sigma_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ characterizes the risk structure of these assets. Traditional factor models decompose returns as:

$$r_t = Bf_t + \epsilon_t$$

where:
- $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ is the factor loading matrix
- $f_t \in \mathbb{R}^k$ is the vector of factor returns
- $\epsilon_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of idiosyncratic returns

The covariance matrix is then estimated as:

$$\Sigma_t = B\Sigma_f B^T + D$$

where $\Sigma_f$ is the factor covariance matrix and $D$ is a diagonal matrix of idiosyncratic variances.

### 2.2 Deep Risk Model Architecture

Our Deep Risk Model extends this framework by learning the factor structure through a deep neural network:

$$f_t = \mathcal{T}(X_t)$$

where:
- $X_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d \times \tau}$ is the market data tensor (n assets, d features, τ time steps)
- $\mathcal{T}(\cdot)$ is a transformer-based neural network

#### 2.2.1 Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture processes the input data through several layers:

1. **Multi-Head Attention**:
   $$\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O$$
   
   where each head is computed as:
   $$\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)$$
   
   and the attention function is:
   $$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

2. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**:
   $$\text{FFN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2$$

3. **Layer Normalization**:
   $$\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \gamma \odot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta$$
   
   where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation computed over the feature dimension.

#### 2.2.2 Temporal Fusion Transformer

The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) extends the basic transformer by incorporating:

1. **Variable Selection Network (VSN)**:
   $$\alpha_t = \text{softmax}(W_{\alpha} \cdot \text{GRU}(x_t) + b_{\alpha})$$
   $$\tilde{x}_t = \alpha_t \odot x_t$$

2. **Static-Temporal Feature Processing**:
   $$s = \text{VSN}_s(s_{\text{static}})$$
   $$x_t = \text{VSN}_t(x_{\text{temporal}})$$
   $$\tilde{x}_t = \text{GRU}(x_t)$$
   $$\hat{x}_t = \text{StaticEnrichment}(\tilde{x}_t, s)$$

3. **Self-Attention Mechanism**:
   $$\text{SelfAttention}(X) = \text{MultiHead}(X, X, X)$$

4. **Gating Layer**:
   $$g_t = \sigma(W_g \cdot x_t + b_g)$$
   $$\tilde{x}_t = g_t \odot x_t + (1 - g_t) \odot \text{skip}(x_t)$$

### 2.3 Factor Analysis

#### 2.3.1 Factor Orthogonalization

We apply Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to ensure factor orthogonality:

For factors $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_k$, we compute orthogonal factors $\hat{f}_1, \hat{f}_2, \ldots, \hat{f}_k$ as:

$$\hat{f}_1 = \frac{f_1}{||f_1||}$$

For $i = 2, 3, \ldots, k$:

$$\hat{f}_i = \frac{f_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_i)}{||f_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_i)||}$$

where $\text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_i) = \frac{\langle f_i, \hat{f}_j \rangle}{\langle \hat{f}_j, \hat{f}_j \rangle} \hat{f}_j$

#### 2.3.2 Factor Quality Metrics

We evaluate factor quality using several metrics:

1. **Information Coefficient (IC)**:
   $$\text{IC} = \text{corr}(f_t, r_{t+1})$$

2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**:
   $$\text{VIF}_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}$$
   
   where $R_i^2$ is the R-squared from regressing factor $i$ on all other factors.

3. **T-statistic**:
   $$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}}{\text{SE}(\hat{\beta})}$$
   
   where $\hat{\beta}$ is the estimated factor loading and $\text{SE}(\hat{\beta})$ is its standard error.

4. **Explained Variance**:
   $$\text{ExpVar} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}$$

### 2.4 Covariance Estimation

We estimate the covariance matrix using the factor model:

$$\Sigma_t = B\Sigma_f B^T + D$$

where:
- $B$ is estimated by regressing asset returns on factor returns
- $\Sigma_f$ is estimated from the historical factor returns
- $D$ is estimated from the residuals of the regression

## 3. Mathematical Proofs

### 3.1 Proof of Factor Orthogonality

**Theorem 1**: The Gram-Schmidt process produces orthogonal factors.

**Proof**:
Let $\hat{f}_1, \hat{f}_2, \ldots, \hat{f}_k$ be the orthogonalized factors. We prove by induction that $\langle \hat{f}_i, \hat{f}_j \rangle = 0$ for all $i \neq j$.

Base case: There is only one factor $\hat{f}_1$, so the statement is vacuously true.

Inductive step: Assume $\langle \hat{f}_i, \hat{f}_j \rangle = 0$ for all $1 \leq i < j \leq m$. We need to show that $\langle \hat{f}_i, \hat{f}_{m+1} \rangle = 0$ for all $i \leq m$.

By definition:
$$\hat{f}_{m+1} = \frac{f_{m+1} - \sum_{j=1}^{m} \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1})}{||f_{m+1} - \sum_{j=1}^{m} \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1})||}$$

For any $i \leq m$:
$$\langle \hat{f}_i, \hat{f}_{m+1} \rangle = \frac{\langle \hat{f}_i, f_{m+1} - \sum_{j=1}^{m} \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1}) \rangle}{||f_{m+1} - \sum_{j=1}^{m} \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1})||}$$

Expanding:
$$\langle \hat{f}_i, f_{m+1} - \sum_{j=1}^{m} \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1}) \rangle = \langle \hat{f}_i, f_{m+1} \rangle - \sum_{j=1}^{m} \langle \hat{f}_i, \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1}) \rangle$$

Since $\text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1}) = \frac{\langle f_{m+1}, \hat{f}_j \rangle}{\langle \hat{f}_j, \hat{f}_j \rangle} \hat{f}_j$:

$$\langle \hat{f}_i, \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1}) \rangle = \frac{\langle f_{m+1}, \hat{f}_j \rangle}{\langle \hat{f}_j, \hat{f}_j \rangle} \langle \hat{f}_i, \hat{f}_j \rangle$$

By the inductive hypothesis, $\langle \hat{f}_i, \hat{f}_j \rangle = 0$ for $i \neq j$, so:

$$\langle \hat{f}_i, \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1}) \rangle = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i \neq j \\
\langle f_{m+1}, \hat{f}_i \rangle & \text{if } i = j
\end{cases}$$

Therefore:
$$\langle \hat{f}_i, f_{m+1} - \sum_{j=1}^{m} \text{proj}_{\hat{f}_j}(f_{m+1}) \rangle = \langle \hat{f}_i, f_{m+1} \rangle - \langle f_{m+1}, \hat{f}_i \rangle = 0$$

Thus, $\langle \hat{f}_i, \hat{f}_{m+1} \rangle = 0$ for all $i \leq m$, completing the proof.

### 3.2 Proof of Covariance Decomposition

**Theorem 2**: The covariance matrix can be decomposed as $\Sigma = B\Sigma_f B^T + D$ under the factor model.

**Proof**:
Under the factor model, returns are given by $r_t = Bf_t + \epsilon_t$, where $f_t$ and $\epsilon_t$ are uncorrelated.

The covariance matrix of returns is:
$$\Sigma = \text{Cov}(r_t, r_t) = \text{Cov}(Bf_t + \epsilon_t, Bf_t + \epsilon_t)$$

Expanding:
$$\Sigma = \text{Cov}(Bf_t, Bf_t) + \text{Cov}(Bf_t, \epsilon_t) + \text{Cov}(\epsilon_t, Bf_t) + \text{Cov}(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_t)$$

Since $f_t$ and $\epsilon_t$ are uncorrelated, $\text{Cov}(Bf_t, \epsilon_t) = \text{Cov}(\epsilon_t, Bf_t) = 0$.

Therefore:
$$\Sigma = \text{Cov}(Bf_t, Bf_t) + \text{Cov}(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_t)$$

For the first term:
$$\text{Cov}(Bf_t, Bf_t) = B \cdot \text{Cov}(f_t, f_t) \cdot B^T = B\Sigma_f B^T$$

For the second term, assuming idiosyncratic returns are uncorrelated across assets:
$$\text{Cov}(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_t) = D$$

where $D$ is a diagonal matrix with $D_{ii} = \text{Var}(\epsilon_{i,t})$.

Thus, $\Sigma = B\Sigma_f B^T + D$, which completes the proof.
