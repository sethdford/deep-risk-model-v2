# Memory Optimization

The Deep Risk Model library provides several memory optimization techniques to efficiently handle large models and datasets. This page explains the available memory optimization strategies and how to use them effectively.

## Overview

When working with large transformer models for risk assessment, memory usage can become a significant constraint. The `memory_opt` module offers several techniques to optimize memory usage:

- **Sparse Tensors**: Store only non-zero elements to reduce memory footprint
- **Chunked Processing**: Process large datasets in manageable chunks
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduce memory usage during backpropagation
- **Memory-Mapped Arrays**: Access large arrays without loading them entirely into memory
- **Memory Pool**: Efficiently reuse tensor allocations

## Memory Configuration

The `MemoryConfig` struct allows you to configure various memory optimization options:

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

let config = MemoryConfig {
    use_sparse_tensors: true,
    use_chunked_processing: true,
    chunk_size: 1000,
    use_gradient_checkpointing: true,
    num_checkpoints: 4,
    use_memory_mapped_arrays: false,
    use_memory_pool: true,
};
```

## Sparse Tensors

Sparse tensors store only non-zero elements, which can significantly reduce memory usage for models with many zero weights.

### Creating a Sparse Tensor

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

// Create a sparse tensor from a dense tensor
let dense_tensor = Tensor::new(&[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 3.0], &[6]);
let sparse_tensor = SparseTensor::from_dense(&dense_tensor, 0.0);

// Get memory usage
let dense_memory = dense_tensor.memory_usage();
let sparse_memory = sparse_tensor.memory_usage();
println!("Memory reduction: {}%", 100.0 * (1.0 - sparse_memory as f64 / dense_memory as f64));

// Convert back to dense
let reconstructed = sparse_tensor.to_dense();
```

### Sparse Matrix Multiplication

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

let sparse_weights = SparseTensor::from_dense(&weights, 0.0);
let result = sparse_weights.sparse_matmul(&input);
```

## Chunked Processing

Chunked processing allows you to handle large datasets by processing them in smaller, memory-efficient chunks.

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

let processor = ChunkedProcessor::new(1000); // Chunk size of 1000
let result = processor.process_in_chunks(&large_dataset, |chunk| {
    // Process each chunk
    model.forward(chunk)
});
```

## Gradient Checkpointing

Gradient checkpointing reduces memory usage during backpropagation by recomputing intermediate activations instead of storing them.

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

let checkpointer = GradientCheckpointer::new(4); // 4 checkpoints
let result = checkpointer.forward_with_checkpointing(&model, &input);
```

## Memory-Mapped Arrays

Memory-mapped arrays allow you to work with arrays larger than available RAM by mapping them to disk.

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

let mmap_array = MemoryMappedArray::new("large_array.bin", &[1000000, 1000]);

// Read a slice
let slice = mmap_array.read_slice(&[0, 0], &[100, 100]);

// Write a slice
mmap_array.write_slice(&[100, 0], &new_data);
```

## Memory Pool

The memory pool allows efficient reuse of tensor allocations, reducing the overhead of frequent allocations and deallocations.

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

let mut pool = MemoryPool::new();

// Allocate a tensor from the pool
let tensor1 = pool.allocate(&[1000, 1000]);

// Use tensor1...

// Release the tensor back to the pool
pool.release(tensor1);

// Get another tensor of the same size (reuses the previous allocation)
let tensor2 = pool.allocate(&[1000, 1000]);

// Clear the pool when done
pool.clear();
```

## Best Practices

Here are some recommendations for optimizing memory usage:

1. **Use sparse tensors** for models with many zero or near-zero weights
2. **Enable chunked processing** for large datasets
3. **Configure gradient checkpointing** for training large models
4. **Use memory-mapped arrays** for datasets larger than available RAM
5. **Implement a memory pool** for applications with frequent tensor allocations

## Performance Considerations

Memory optimization techniques often involve trade-offs between memory usage and computation time:

- Sparse tensors reduce memory but may increase computation time for dense operations
- Chunked processing reduces peak memory but adds overhead for chunk management
- Gradient checkpointing reduces memory during training but increases computation time
- Memory-mapped arrays allow processing of large datasets but have slower access times

Choose the appropriate techniques based on your specific constraints and requirements.

## Example

Here's a complete example demonstrating memory optimization techniques:

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a transformer risk model
    let model = TransformerRiskModel::new(
        ModelConfig {
            input_dim: 100,
            hidden_dim: 512,
            num_layers: 6,
            num_heads: 8,
            dropout: 0.1,
        },
        MemoryConfig {
            use_sparse_tensors: true,
            use_chunked_processing: true,
            chunk_size: 1000,
            use_gradient_checkpointing: true,
            num_checkpoints: 4,
            use_memory_mapped_arrays: false,
            use_memory_pool: true,
        },
    );

    // Generate synthetic market data
    let market_data = MarketData::generate_synthetic(10000, 100);
    
    // Process data in chunks
    let processor = ChunkedProcessor::new(1000);
    let risk_factors = processor.process_in_chunks(&market_data, |chunk| {
        model.generate_risk_factors(chunk)
    })?;
    
    println!("Generated risk factors with shape: {:?}", risk_factors.shape());
    println!("Peak memory usage: {} MB", model.peak_memory_usage() / (1024 * 1024));
    
    Ok(())
}
```
