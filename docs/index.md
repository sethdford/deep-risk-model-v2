# Deep Risk Model

A high-performance risk modeling system using transformer-based architecture and hardware-accelerated computations.

## Overview

The Deep Risk Model is a state-of-the-art financial risk modeling system that leverages deep learning techniques to provide accurate risk assessments and forecasts.

## Key Features

- Transformer-based architecture for capturing complex market dynamics
- Hardware acceleration support for high-performance computing
- Regime-aware risk modeling for different market conditions
- Comprehensive backtesting framework
- Scenario analysis capabilities

## Installation

```bash
cargo add deep_risk_model
```

## Basic Usage

```rust
use deep_risk_model::prelude::*;

// Create a transformer-based risk model
let model = TransformerRiskModel::new(64, 8, 256, 3)?;

// Load market data
let market_data = MarketData::new(returns, features);

// Generate risk factors
let risk_factors = model.generate_risk_factors(&market_data).await?;

// Estimate covariance matrix
let covariance = model.estimate_covariance(&market_data).await?;
```
