    "title": "Memory Optimization",
    "content": "# Memory Optimization The Deep Risk Model library provides several memory optimization techniques to efficiently handle large models and datasets. This page explains the available memory optimization strategies and how to use them effectively. ## Overview When working with large transformer models for risk assessment, memory usage can become a significant constraint. The `memory_opt` module offers several techniques to optimize memory usage: - **Sparse Tensors**: Store only non-zero elements to reduce memory footprint - **Chunked Processing**: Process large datasets in manageable chunks - **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduce memory usage during backpropagation - **Memory-Mapped Arrays**: Access large arrays without loading them entirely into memory - **Memory Pool**: Efficiently reuse tensor allocations ## Memory Configuration The `MemoryConfig` struct allows you to configure various memory optimization options: ## Sparse Tensors Sparse tensors store only non-zero elements, which can significantly reduce memory usage for models with many zero weights. ### Creating a Sparse Tensor ### Sparse Matrix Multiplication ## Chunked Processing Chunked processing allows you to handle large datasets by processing them in smaller, memory-efficient chunks. ## Gradient Checkpointing Gradient checkpointing reduces memory usage during backpropagation by recomputing intermediate activations instead of storing them. ## Memory-Mapped Arrays Memory-mapped arrays allow you to work with arrays larger than available RAM by mapping them to disk. ## Memory Pool The memory pool allows efficient reuse of tensor allocations, reducing the overhead of frequent allocations and deallocations. ## Best Practices Here are some recommendations for optimizing memory usage: 1. **Use sparse tensors** for models with many zero or near-zero weights 2. **Enable chunked processing** for large datasets 3. **Configure gradient checkpointing** for training large models 4. **Use memory-mapped arrays** for datasets larger than available RAM 5. **Implement a memory pool** for applications with frequent tensor allocations ## Performance Considerations Memory optimization techniques often involve trade-offs between memory usage and computation time: - Sparse tensors reduce memory but may increase computation time for dense operations - Chunked processing reduces peak memory but adds overhead for chunk management - Gradient checkpointing reduces memory during training but increases computation time - Memory-mapped arrays allow processing of large datasets but have slower access times Choose the appropriate techniques based on your specific constraints and requirements. ## Example Here's a complete example demonstrating memory optimization techniques: For more detailed examples, see the [memory optimization example]({{ site.url }}/examples/memory-optimization) in the examples section.",

    "title": "Quantization",
    "content": "# Quantization Quantization is a technique to reduce the precision of model weights and activations, resulting in smaller model sizes and faster inference times. The Deep Risk Model library provides comprehensive quantization support to optimize models for deployment. ## Overview The `quantization` module offers several features for model compression: - **Per-tensor quantization**: Apply the same scale factor to an entire tensor - **Per-channel quantization**: Apply different scale factors to each channel - **Multiple precision options**: Int8, Int16, Float16, and Float32 - **Quantization-aware training**: Train models with simulated quantization - **Post-training quantization**: Quantize pre-trained models ## Quantization Configuration The `QuantizationConfig` struct allows you to configure various quantization options: ### Precision Options The library supports the following precision types: - `Precision::Int8`: 8-bit integer quantization (smallest size, lowest precision) - `Precision::Int16`: 16-bit integer quantization - `Precision::Float16`: 16-bit floating point (half precision) - `Precision::Float32`: 32-bit floating point (full precision, no quantization) ## Quantizing a Tensor You can quantize individual tensors using the `QuantizedTensor` struct: ## Per-Channel Quantization Per-channel quantization applies different scale factors to each channel, which can improve accuracy for weights with varying distributions across channels: ## Quantizing a Model To quantize an entire model, use the `Quantizer` struct: ## Calibration Methods The library supports different calibration methods to determine the optimal scale factors: - `CalibrationMethod::MinMax`: Uses the minimum and maximum values - `CalibrationMethod::Percentile`: Uses percentile values to exclude outliers - `CalibrationMethod::Entropy`: Minimizes information loss during quantization - `CalibrationMethod::MSE`: Minimizes mean squared error Example with percentile calibration: ## Quantization-Aware Training For best results, you can train models with simulated quantization: ## Best Practices Here are some recommendations for effective quantization: 1. **Start with higher precision**: Begin with Float16 or Int16 and gradually reduce to Int8 if accuracy is acceptable 2. **Use per-channel quantization** for weights, especially in convolutional and linear layers 3. **Apply symmetric quantization** for weights and asymmetric for activations 4. **Consider quantization-aware training** for critical models to minimize accuracy loss 5. **Benchmark performance** to ensure quantization provides the expected speedup 6. **Monitor accuracy metrics** to ensure quantization doesn't significantly impact model performance ## Performance Considerations Quantization involves trade-offs between model size, inference speed, and accuracy: - Int8 quantization typically reduces model size by 75% compared to Float32 - Inference speed can improve by 2-4x with optimized Int8 operations - Accuracy loss varies by model and task, but is typically 1-2% for Int8 quantization ## Example Here's a complete example demonstrating quantization techniques: For more detailed examples, see the [quantization example]({{ site.url }}/examples/quantization) in the examples section.",

Document any patterns or issues found ### Files to Clean Based on compiler warnings, the following files need attention: #### Core Files - [ ] src/error.rs - [ ] src/gat.rs - [ ] src/gru.rs - [ ] src/model.rs - [ ] src/types.rs - [ ] src/utils.rs - [ ] src/factor_analysis.rs - [ ] src/regime.rs - [ ] src/regime_risk_model.rs - [ ] src/backtest.rs - [ ] src/stress_testing.rs #### Transformer Module - [ ] src/transformer/mod.rs - [ ] src/transformer/attention.rs - [ ] src/transformer/position.rs - [ ] src/transformer/layer.rs - [ ] src/transformer/model.rs - [ ] src/transformer/temporal_fusion.rs - [ ] src/transformer/utils.rs #### Risk Models - [ ] src/transformer_risk_model.rs - [ ] src/tft_risk_model.rs #### Tests - [ ] tests/e2e_tests.rs - [ ] tests/integration_tests.rs - [ ] tests/mod.rs - [ ] tests/stress_testing_integration.rs ### Execution Steps 1. Run `cargo clippy` to get a baseline of warnings 2. For each file: - Remove unused imports - Run `cargo test` to ensure no regressions - Document any imports that appear unused but are actually needed 3. Run `cargo clippy` again to verify warnings are reduced 4. Update documentation if import patterns reveal design issues ### Potential Challenges - Some imports may be used only in test code - Macro-expanded code might use imports that appear unused - Some imports might be needed for trait implementations ### Success Criteria - All unnecessary imports removed - No new compiler warnings introduced - All tests passing - Documentation updated if needed ## Task 2: Add Missing Documentation for Public APIs ### Overview Several public APIs lack proper documentation, making it difficult for users to understand how to use them correctly. This task aims to add comprehensive documentation to all public APIs. ### Approach 1. Identify public APIs without documentation 2. Add documentation following Rust documentation standards 3. Include examples where appropriate 4. Ensure documentation builds correctly ### APIs to Document - [ ] Public traits in src/types.rs - [ ] Public structs and methods in src/model.rs - [ ] Public functions in src/utils.rs - [ ] Public components in src/transformer/mod.rs ### Documentation Standards - Each public item should have a doc comment - Doc comments should explain what the item does, not how it works - Include parameters and return values descriptions - Add examples for complex APIs - Use proper Markdown formatting ### Execution Steps 1. Run `cargo doc --no-deps` to identify undocumented items 2. For each undocumented item: - Add appropriate documentation - Include examples where helpful - Ensure documentation builds with `cargo doc --no-deps` 3. Review documentation for clarity and completeness ### Success Criteria - All public APIs documented - Documentation builds without warnings - Examples provided for complex APIs - Documentation follows Rust standards",
